    <p>Verb tenses are changes or additions to verbs to show when the action took place: in the past, present, or
        future. The phrase verb tense is also used for <u class="uclass">grammatical aspects</u>, which add more details about the duration or
        time an action takes. When you combine the four grammatical aspects with the past, present and future, you end
        up with twelve main verb tenses in English.

        Verb <u class="uclass">tenses</u> are <span class="fcolor">essential </span> for speaking English correctly, but with all the different forms and functions, they
        can get confusing. In this guide, we give a quick overview of the English tenses, including when to use them and
        how to make them, and give plenty of verb tense examples.
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading1">What is a verb tense?</h3>
    <p>Verb tenses show when an action took place, as well as how long it occurred. The main verb tenses are the past, present, and future. 
<br>
<br>
        There are also additional aspects that give extra details, such as the length of time the action occurred, which actions happened first, or whether a past action has an impact on the present. These grammatical aspects are the simple tense, perfect tense, continuous tense, and perfect continuous tense. </p>

        <h3 class="heading1">Verb tenses list: How many tenses are there in English?</h3>
        <p>The standard tense in English is the present tense, which is usually just the root form of the verb. The past and future tenses often require changes or additions to the root form, such as the suffix<span class="fcolor">-ed</span> for the past tense and the modal verb will for the future. 

            However, for each of the past, present, and future tenses, there are four different aspects that add additional details. For example, the continuous tense shows that an action is ongoing. It can be used in the present (she is sleeping), past (she was sleeping), or future (she will be sleeping). </p>

            <h3 class="heading1">Past, present, and future tenses</h3>
            <p>The past, present, and future are the central divisions of time in English. The present represents actions happening now, while the past represents actions that happened earlier, and the future describes actions that will happen later. </p>
